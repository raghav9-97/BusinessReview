Great one as usual. Lovely food court.
Bad experience ever is a McDonald's really providing french fries a simple potato chips? The potatoes are not filled and too much thick feels like eating potato from roadside not a feel like McDonald never go to this cafe the service also too bad and the burger not fresh and feels like a roadside burger

"Nice place to eat in a mall. Chocolate shake with meal & Icecream in the end are great here, for summer."
Tasty food...I come here for Happy meal...pls put some good toys like minion collection!! 😔
"Their veg wraps, burgers and floating ice cream are super awesome. I wish the order counters move fast coz the customer queue will be very long!!"
Few of the items are of great quality and tasty but not all.we visited few times here and found budget friendly compare to same kind of food offered by other brands in the city.alsothe response of the staff was not a great experience but ...
"Or very own McDonald for quick bite of different kind of burger, wraps and different kinds of shakes and drinks."
"My daughter simply loves the pizza puff and fries. Great place to have some quick bites. the paneer warp, egg burger and egg warps are simply best. However I was little disappointed with the chicken burger. May be they should try to bring new variations of chicken."
Love the McD egg burger. MCD is a food factory
It is my favorite place in Vizag. Burgers Here are awesome. McDonald's is the best in the world. Till now many people in vizag including me waited for McDonald's in vizag. It is newly constructed in vizag. Time for preparation of food here is fast. It is the biggest fast food center in CMR Central. Its is in 5th floor.
You can get a quick bite in a less than 100 rs bill.
Burgerrr yummyyyyyyy..love to have it daily after my work .😍😍😍
As you all know mcD is  a large chain of restaurants with tasty and spicy junk food
Great place for a quick bite. Service is fast and the items delicious.
"What can I say It is a' Mc donald's' and unlike The opening timings mentioned for each store/ the stores - none of Them, ever open up in time for breakfast.'"
Great service. Great food.
